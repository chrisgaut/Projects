# Launch Speed Bot
The Launch Speed Bot, or @launchspeedbot on Twitter, is my first attempt at creating a Twitter bot. This R script is automated to run at 11 A.M. every morning during the Major League Baseball regular season. The script scrapes pitch-by-pitch data from all the previous day's action, drills down to the top 5 hardest hit batted balls, and posts the list for fans to see the next morning. 

Skills: R, Twitter API, data manipulation, automation
